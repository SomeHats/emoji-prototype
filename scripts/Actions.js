/***

Agent actions! They're basically short code statements.
Actions can include other actions, like ‚Äúif condition then [Other Action]‚Äù
They're also meant to be easily serializeable into JSON, like so:

states: [
	{
		id: UID_0,
		icon: " ",
		name: "empty",
		actions: []
	},
	{
		id: UID_1
		icon: "üí©",
		name: "poo",
		actions:[
			{
				type: "if_neighbor",
				sign: "equal"
				num: 2,
				state: UID_1
				actions:[
					{
						type:"go_to_state",
						state: UID_0
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
]

This translates to a üí© state, with the action that
if exactly two of its neighbors are üí©'s, it'll become empty.

This should also make it easier to make a human-facing UI for.
Probably.
